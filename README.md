# プロキシ (Purokishi)

A proxy server made out necessity.

## History

I was sitting in a co-working space in Kobe, Japan, when I decided to listen to some tunes on my preferred internet music site, Songza. It turns out that they are blocking Japanese IP addresses (or more correctly, redirecting them to their text content size [daily.songza.com](http://daily.songza.com/), which is not bad, just not what I wanted at the time. It turns out that this is common practive for internet music sites, as I was unable to use all of the following:

- Songza
- Pandora

Ok, not that many, but you get the point. So I decided to roll my own proxy server to get in the groove of writing code again, after my two-week hiatus.
